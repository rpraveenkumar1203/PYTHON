This project aims to predict the price of second-hand cars using regression algorithms. My model is trained on data from Cardekho. This can be useful for both customers and sellers to know the price of a used car based on its configurations.

This data here using from cardekho website, below are the process i had done to predict the model as per sales history 

Importing
=========
Libraries 
Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis
===========================
Handling missing values
Understanding the features of dataset
Visualizing the dataset
Separating independent and dependent features
Encoding the values for the model and Transforming the value

Model selection and Training 
============================
Splitting the dataset for training and test data
Training the dataset with all regression model
Checking the model performance which having best scores 

Hyperparameter tuning 
======================
Picking the two Model with best accuracy 
Tuning the parameter with grid search
Checking the accuracy score 

Pickling 
========
Saving the trained model and made pickle file
